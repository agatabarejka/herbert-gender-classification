BERT-based classification of childs gender based on mothers speech

** in progress **

In this repo you will find code for my masters thesis on Cognitive Science programme.

*Subjective*: predicting a child's sex/gender based on mother's speech (CDS - child-directed-speech) <br><br>
*Intention*: the goal of the study was to find out if CDS directed to girls and boys differs enough in order to predict the child's gender.<br>
If so, different speech can further have an impact on the child's development, and therefore it's important to study what are these differences and where do they come from<br><br>
*Data*: data comes from mother-child dyads, which were video-taped, and later the audio layer was transcribed in Praat program<br><br>
*Model*: Allegro's HerBERT model, which is a BERT-based model trained on Polish corpora: https://github.com/allegro/HerBERT
